    LeetCode 88 - Merge Sorted Array

    The final sorted array should not be returned by the function,
    but instead be stored inside the array nums1.
    To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements
    denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0
    and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.
