        Given:

        Problem:
        - Find two indices in the list such that the sum of the elements at those indices equals the target.
        Thought Process:
        - Take the fist element and check difference with the target available in the hash_map.
        - If the difference is found in the hash_map, return the indices.
        - If not found, add the current number and its index to the hash_map.
        Approach:
        - Use a hash_map to store the numbers and their indices as we iterate through the list.
        Solution:
        - Iterate through the list, calculate the difference between the target and the current number.
        - Check if the difference exists in the hash_map.
        - If it exists, return the indices of the current number and the number from the hash_map.
